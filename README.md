#Parent Contacts
Allows teachers to keep track of their students' parent contact information so they can focus on more important things like teaching. The teacher will need to log in first. Once logged in, they will be able to see all their students and their parents. Teachers will have access to see, edit, delete, and create contacts with confidence that their information and students information will not be shared with others.
